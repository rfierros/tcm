**User and Cyclists Management System for TCM Community**

This project is a Laravel-based web application designed to manage cyclists and users inspired by the dynamics of PCM under the standards of the TCM community. Starting from season 4, the platform allows users to create, update, and analyze detailed profiles of cyclists, incorporating performance attributes such as climbing, sprinting, time-trialing, and other key metrics. 



This system aims to provide a robust tool for cycling enthusiasts and managers looking to simulate and manage virtual teams with real-world cycling performance considerations.
